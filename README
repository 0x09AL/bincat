=important remark

=ocaml headers
OCAML headers are not installed in /usr/include or /usr/local/include, where
gcc looks for them, when installing from source.

Two solutions may be applied when compiling the Python using python2 setup.py build:
* Create a symlink (/usr/include/caml -> /usr/lib/ocaml/caml/, or
  /usr/local/include/caml -> /usr/local/lib/ocaml/caml/). This seems to be done
  in the debian packages.
* export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/ocaml
